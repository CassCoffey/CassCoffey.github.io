# Risk Of Ruina

A Risk Of Rain 2 mod that I worked with a friend on. She created all of the 3D models used, and I handled the rest of the project from code to animation.
By the time I stopped supporting the mod, there were two fully featured characters with skins and achievements as well as a number of items. The mod was popular enough that I handed it off to another team who still keeps it patched.
The characters are both fully networked and designed with compatability with other mods in mind. While I was actively supporting the mod I recieved and responded to bug reports and feature requests.
