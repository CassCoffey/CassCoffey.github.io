# Lethal Phones

A Lethal Company mod that I worked on with a friend. She created all the models and textures used. I developed everything else.
The phones are fully networked and designed to fit as seamlessly into the Lethal Company design language as possible. They are performant and focused on compatability with other mods.
Lethal Company was an interesting challenge to work with, code-base wise. I learned how to use Harmony Transpilers to patch base-game methods without compromising compatibility with other mods or game updates.
