# **About Me**

Heya! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br><br>
Game Dev has been my passion for a very long time, ever since I wrote my first Lua scripts in Garry's Mod over a decade ago. Since then I've worked on many different projects, from rapid prototypes of gameplay systems to fully featured mods for popular games.<br>
While Unity and C# have been my go-to game development tools for nearly 10 years now, I've learned many other systems and languages on the side.<br>
The Projects page above shows my more significant endeavors, but between those I'm always challenging myself and learning new skills. Whether its writing up a quick balance or bugfix mod for a game my friends are playing, trying out various other game engines such as Godot or Twine, or brushing up on other skills such as animation and video editing; the ability to learn and adapt to any system or architecture is my greatest strength.<br>
